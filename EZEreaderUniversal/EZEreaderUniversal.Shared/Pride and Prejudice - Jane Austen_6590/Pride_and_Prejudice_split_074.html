The commentary has been culled from sources as diverse as reviews contemporaneous with the work, letters written by the author, literary criticism of later generations, and appreciations written throughout history. Following the commentary, a series of questions seeks to filter Jane Austen’s</span> Pride and Prejudice <span class="italic">through a variety of points of view and bring about a richer understanding of this enduring work</span></p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"> COMMENTS</span></span></p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">WALTER ALLEN </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">More can be learnt from Miss Austen about the nature of the novel than from almost any other writer.</p><p class="calibre13">—from <span class="italic">The English Novel</span> (1954)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">JANE AUSTEN </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">What should I do with your strong, manly, spirited sketches, full of variety and glow? How could I possibly join them on to the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as produces little effect after much labour?</p><p class="calibre13">—from a letter to her nephew James Edward Austen (December 16, 1816)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">E. M. FORSTER </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">Scott misunderstood it when he congratulated her for painting on a square of ivory. She is a miniaturist, but never two-dimensional. All her characters are round, or capable of rotundity.</p><p class="calibre13">—from <span class="italic">Aspects of the Novel</span> (1927)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">SIR WALTER SCOTT </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">Also read again, and for the third time at least, Miss Austen’s very finely written novel of <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span>. That young lady had a talent for describing the involvement and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with. The big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going, but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me. What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!</p><p class="calibre13">—from his journal (March 14, 1826)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">ANTHONY TROLLOPE </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">Miss Austen was surely a great novelist. What she did, she did perfectly. Her work, as far as it goes, is faultness. She wrote of the times in which she lived, of the class of people with which she associated, and in the language which was usual to her as an educated lady. Of romance,—what we generally mean when we speak of romance—she had no tinge. Heroes and heroines with wonderful adventures there are none in her novels. Of great criminals and hidden crimes she tells us nothing. But she places us in a circle of gentlemen and ladies, and charms us while she tells us with an unconscious accuracy how men should act to women, and women act to men. It is not that her people are all good;—and, certainly, they are not all wise. The faults of some are the anvils on which the virtues of others are hammered till they are bright as steel. In the comedy of folly I know no novelist who has beaten her. The letters of Mr. Collins, a clergyman in <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span>, would move laughter in a low-church archbishop.</p><p class="calibre13">—from a lecture (1870)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">W. SOMERSET MAUGHAM </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">Nothing very much happens in her books, and yet, when you come to the bottom of a page, you eagerly turn it to learn what will happen next. Nothing very much does and again you eagerly turn the page. The novelist who has the power to achieve this has the most precious gift a novelist can possess.</p><p class="calibre13">—from <span class="italic">Ten Novels and Their Authors</span> (1955)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">CHARLOTTE BRONTË </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">I had not seen <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span> till I had read that sentence of yours, and then I got the book. And what did I find? An accurate daguerreotyped portrait of a commonplace face; a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of a bright vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck. I should hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen, in their elegant but confined houses. These observations will probably irritate you, but I shall run the risk.</p><p class="calibre13">—from a letter to George Lewes (January 12, 1848)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">MARK TWAIN </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">Jane Austen’s books, too, are absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn’t a book in it.</p><p class="calibre13">—from <span class="italic">Following the Equator</span> (1897)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold">RALPH WALDO EMERSON </span></span></p><p class="calibre6">I am at a loss to understand why people hold Miss Austen’s novels at so high a rate, which seem to me vulgar in tone, sterile in artistic invention, imprisoned in their wretched conventions of English society, without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world. Never was life so pinched and narrow. . . . Suicide is more respectable.</p><p class="calibre13">—from his Journal (1861)</p><p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"> QUESTIONS</span></span></p><blockquote class="calibre27">1. Much is said concerning the subtlety and refinement of Austen’s writing. What techniques does she employ to achieve this delicacy and minuteness? Is “mininaturism” an accurate description of her style?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre28">2. Would Austen’s meticulous style be as effective if she were to write in forms other than the novel—for example, the short story? Are her abilities—for example, her gift for dialog—convertible to playwriting?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre28">3. Would you like <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span> more if Austen’s satire of the social milieu, of class distinctions, of her characters’ pride and prejudice, was more savage?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre28">4. Is Emerson’s complaint that “never was life so pinched and narrow” justified?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre28">5. What is the source of this novel’s immense and enduring popularity?</blockquote><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_74"></div></div></body></html>
