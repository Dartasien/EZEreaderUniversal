He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,—</p><p class="calibre18">“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</p><p class="calibre18">“We are not in a way to know <span class="italic">what</span> Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother, resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</p><p class="calibre18">“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”</p><p class="calibre18">“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”</p><p class="calibre18">“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.”</p><p class="calibre18">Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p><p class="calibre18">“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</p><p class="calibre18">“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.”</p><a class="calibre11"></a><p class="calibre18" id="filepos89970">“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”<a href="Pride_and_Prejudice_split_072.html#filepos893593" class="calibre7"><sup class="calibre22"><span class="calibre8">2</span></sup></a> “To-morrow fortnight.”</p><p class="calibre18">“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”</p><p class="calibre18">“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to <span class="italic">her</span>.”</p><p class="calibre18">“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”</p><p class="calibre18">“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if <span class="italic">we</span> do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”</p><p class="calibre18">The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!”</p><a class="calibre11"></a><p class="calibre18" id="filepos91326">“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <span class="italic">there</span>. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know and read great books, and make extracts.”<a href="Pride_and_Prejudice_split_076.html#filepos925096" class="calibre7"><sup class="calibre22"><span class="calibre8">d</span></sup></a></p><p class="calibre18">Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.</p><p class="calibre18">“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”</p><p class="calibre18">“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p><p class="calibre18">“I am sorry to hear <span class="italic">that</span>; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</p><p class="calibre18">The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.</p><p class="calibre18">“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet. But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.”</p><p class="calibre18">“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.</p><p class="calibre18">“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you <span class="italic">are</span> the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”</p><p class="calibre18">“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I <span class="italic">am</span> the youngest, I’m the tallest.”</p><p class="calibre18">The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.</p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div></div></body></html>
